        " Q1:To obtain a causal estimate of the treatment effectiveness, we can employ various analytical methods, such as regression analysis, propensity score matching, instrumental variable analysis, or randomized controlled trials (if feasible). Since this study is observational , the true casual effect cannot be studied easily and all the results will be biased.\n",
        "\n",
        "Lets say if the study was randomized then we can account logistic regression to estimate the effect of using mosquito net on the risk of contracting dengue, but again the dependent variable (risk of contracting dengue) is not binary(range 0-100) , before applying logistic regression we have to transform it in binary variable using a threshold score or multi-category variable(muti-category logistic regression).\n",
        "\n",
        "Again treatment variable is a count(net count) , we can use poisson or negative binomial regression if the count data is over dispersed.\n",

        "\n",
        "Propensity Score Matching :  Propensity score matching helps balance the observed covariates between treated and untreated groups to reduce selection bias. You can estimate the propensity scores (the likelihood of receiving the treatment) using logistic regression and then match treated and untreated individuals based on these scores. After matching, we can compare the dengue risk between the matched groups to estimate the treatment effect.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instrumental Variable Analysis: If there are concerns about endogeneity or unobserved confounders influencing both mosquito net usage and dengue risk, instrumental variable analysis can be used. An instrumental variable is a variable that affects the treatment variable but is not directly related to the outcome except through its effect on the treatment. This method requires identifying a valid instrumental variable, such as eligibility for the free net program, and using it to instrument for mosquito net usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "We could aslo get more data for other counfounding factors such as environmental condition (geographical and weather condition) or municiple effectivness could also affect dengue_risk directly or indirectly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Whether the analysis shows a cause-and-effect relationship depends on how well we assume things and how carefully we analyze the data. If our assumptions are correct and our analysis deals with problems like confounding factors and bias, then we can say for sure that the results show cause and effect.\n"

        "Assumption 4: Independence of Errors: Assume that the errors in the regression model are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), meaning that there is no systematic bias in the residuals.\n",
