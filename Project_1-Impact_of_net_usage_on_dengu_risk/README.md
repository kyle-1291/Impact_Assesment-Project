# 📊 <span style="color:#2A9D8F;">**Impact of net usage on dengue risk** </span>
<div class="project-section">

## 📝 **Project Overview**
<p style="background-color:Tomato;">This project aims to investigate whether using mosquito nets reduces the risk of contracting dengue among households in a district in India. The analysis is based on a dataset collected from **1,752 households**, containing variables related to environmental factors, individual health, and household characteristics.</p>

### Data_Set : [mosquito_net.csv](https://github.com/kyle-1291/Impact_Assesment-Project/blob/8d54ade7169eb4f15e0e0b28f88f404edd50421c/Project_1-Impact_of_net_usage_on_dengu_risk/dengue_nets.csv)

## 🌍 **Research Context**
A special government program provides free mosquito nets to eligible households based on the following criteria:

- **Household Size:** More than 4 members.
- **Monthly Income:** Less than ₹7,000 per month.

However, households are not automatically enrolled in the program, and participation is **voluntary**. As a result, there are discrepancies in net usage among eligible households. This scenario creates a natural observational setting where understanding causal relationships is challenging due to potential **self-selection bias** and **confounding factors**.
  
## 📊 **Variable of Interest**

<br>
  <div class="variable-item">
    <span class="variable-title"><b>Insecticide Resistance</b> <sub>(resistance)</sub> :</span>  
    Some strains of mosquitoes are more resistant to insecticide, posing a higher risk of dengue infection. Measured on a scale of 0–100, with higher values indicating greater resistance.

## ❓ **Research Question**
### **Primary Research Question:**  
Does using mosquito nets decrease an individual’s risk of contracting dengue?

The outcome variable is **dengue_risk**, measured on a scale of 0 to 100, with higher values indicating a greater risk. The treatment variable is **net**, indicating whether a household uses a mosquito net. Alternatively, we can use **net_num** to assess the intensity of net usage (number of nets in the household).

## 🔍 **Project Steps**
1. **Naive Model Analysis:**
    - Build a naive model to estimate the baseline relationship between net usage and dengue risk.
    - This step will help establish initial associations but will not yield a causal estimate due to potential confounding.
    
2. **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG):**
    - Construction of  DAG to visually represent causal relationships.
    - Identify confounding variables and assess which paths need to be controlled for to achieve a valid causal estimate.

3. **Minimum Sufficient Adjustment Set:**
    - Based on the DAG, determine the variables that must be adjusted to isolate the causal effect of <strong>net usage</strong> on <strong>dengue risk</strong>.

4. **Comparing Binary vs. Count Treatment Variables:**
    - Explore whether using **net** (binary) or **net_num** (count) as the treatment variable influences the results.
    - Discuss the implications of different treatment variable specifications.

5. **Causal Estimate and Interpretation:**
    - Use causal inference methods such as **Matching** or **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** to estimate the treatment effect.
    - Interpret the results and provide policy recommendations.

## 🗝️ **Key Considerations**
- **Selection Bias:** Households decide whether to participate in the free net program or buy their own nets, introducing potential selection bias.
- **Confounding Variables:** Variables like income, health, and insecticide resistance can confound the relationship between net usage and dengue risk.
- **Program Eligibility Check:** Adjust the dataset to ensure that the **eligible** variable correctly reflects program criteria after necessary income transformations.

This project is an excellent case study in handling **non-experimental data**, applying causal inference methods, and understanding the limitations of **observational studies**.
