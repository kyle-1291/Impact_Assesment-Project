# üìä **Impact of Workers' Compensation Policy Changes on Benifit Duration** 
<br>

## üìù **Project Overview**
<p>This project aims to evaluate the effect of a policy change on the duration of workers‚Äô compensation benefits in a specific state. In July 1980, the state of Kentucky raised the cap on weekly earnings covered by workers' compensation, impacting high-income workers by increasing their benefits. This study uses a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach to compare the duration of benefits for high-income (treatment group) and low-income workers (control group) before and after the policy change.</p>

## üåç **Research Context**
The impact of a policy change increasing the maximum covered weekly earnings on the duration of workers' compensation benefits for high-income workers.

---

## üìÑ **Research Question**
Policy Effect on Benefit Duration: Does the new policy increase the time high-income workers stay on workers' compensation?
Impact on Log Duration: How does the policy affect the log-transformed duration of benefits, considering the skewness in the data?

## üíº **Dataset Information**
The dataset contains 7,150 observations with 30 variables describing worker characteristics, injury types, and compensation amounts.

## üß™ Study Design
- **Treatment Group:**  
  High-income workers (for whom the pre-policy cap was binding).

- **Control Group:**  
  Low-income workers (not affected by the policy change).

- **Outcome Variables:**  
  - `durat`: Benefit duration in weeks  
  - `ldurat`: Log-transformed benefit duration

- **Key Interaction Term:**  
  `afhigh` = `afchnge` * `highearn`, indicating high-income workers post-policy change.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Methodology**
1. **Difference-in-Differences (DiD) Analysis**:
   Calculate the policy effect on durat and ldurat using DiD by manually constructing groups (before_treatment, after_treatment, before_control, after_control) and then running regression analyses.

2. **Regression Analysis without Controls**:
Estimate the impact of the policy change using a simple regression model without adjusting for any other variables.

3. **Regression with Controls**:
Include covariates such as `age`, `marital status`, `industry type`, and `injury severity` to isolate the effect of the policy change on `benefit duration`.

4. **Robustness Check with Other States**:
Use data from Michigan (MI) as an additional comparison group to validate results.

<p>This project provides insights into the unintended consequences of policy changes in workers' compensation benefits, balancing concerns between adequate compensation and potential moral hazard.</p>
